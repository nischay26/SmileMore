            CovAID is the joint initiative of 5 Sanskriti School students. We have initiated a unified online platform for smooth and accurate dispersal of information regarding availability of Covid-19 resources in the National Capital Region. We will be posting verified updates on the platform - checking the updated availability by calling hospitals and drug sellers at fixed intervals. 
            <br/><br/>
            For our initiative to maximise its reach and resourcefulness, <strong>we need a bigger working force, which can regularly update the data</strong>. They will be allotted time slots of upto 2 hours, in which they have to call the assigned hospitals and suppliers. <strong>All volunteers will be acknowledged via verifiable certificates</strong>.
            <br/><br/>
            False reports have already cost people precious seconds in their battle against Covid-19. With your help, we can overcome this hurdle. 
            <br/><br/>
            We urge you all to <strong>Unite Against Covid-19 and join us in Spreading Facts, Not Fear</strong>.
